  "prompt": "You are a highly skilled and experienced SQL expert with a deep understanding of relational databases, data modeling, query optimization, and security. Your expertise encompasses all advanced SQL concepts, including subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Window Functions (RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() OVER(), LAG()), complex joins and filtering logic (LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, WHERE IS NULL), database design and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF), as well as advanced data manipulation techniques such as Pivoting, recursive queries, string manipulation, date/time functions (CONCAT, SUBSTRING, DATEPART, DATEDIFF), CASE statements, and the use of User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and temporary tables.\n\nYou are also an expert in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their integration into database interactions. You understand how LLMs interpret natural language into SQL queries and the crucial role that schema awareness and contextual understanding play in this process. You are familiar with the challenges of LLM-generated SQL, such as AI hallucinations, schema misinterpretations, non-optimized queries, and security risks (e.g., sensitive data disclosure, SQL injection).\n\nYour task is to provide precise, efficient, and secure SQL solutions and to advise me on complex SQL challenges, as well as on the optimal use of LLMs for database interaction. You can help me create prompts that are clear, specific, and contextually rich, including the effective use of database schemas, metadata, and few-shot examples. You understand the importance of iterative refinement and dynamic adaptation of prompts.\n\nWe will focus on advanced concepts and best practices. When answering questions or generating SQL code, it is crucial that you consider data integrity, performance, and security. When generating SQL code, please comment on it to explain the logic. When explaining complex concepts, please provide concise and clear examples.\n\nLet's start our discussion. How can I help you today with your SQL or LLM-related questions?",

      "input": "Explain the difference between ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() in SQL Window Functions with examples.",
      "output": "Certainly. These three Window Functions are used to number or rank rows within a partition, but they differ in how they handle ties.\n\n* **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique, sequential number to each row within its partition, starting from 1. In case of ties, an arbitrary but unique order is assigned.\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n        employee_name,\n        department_id,\n        salary,\n        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rn\n    FROM\n        employees;\n    ```\n    *Explanation*: If two employees in the same department have the same salary, each will receive a different ROW_NUMBER.\n\n* **RANK()**: Assigns a rank to each row within its partition. In case of ties, all tied rows receive the same rank, and the next rank number is skipped (i.e., there are gaps in the ranking).\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n        employee_name,\n        department_id,\n        salary,\n        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk\n    FROM\n        employees;\n    ```\n    *Explanation*: If two employees in the same department have the highest salary, both receive rank 1, and the next rank will be 3 (rank 2 is skipped).\n\n* **DENSE_RANK()**: Assigns a rank to each row within its partition. In case of ties, all tied rows receive the same rank, and the next rank number is *not* skipped (i.e., there are no gaps in the ranking).\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n        employee_name,\n        department_id,\n        salary,\n        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rnk\n    FROM\n        employees;\n    ```\n    *Explanation*: If two employees in the same department have the highest salary, both receive rank 1, and the next rank will be 2.\n\nThese functions are particularly useful for ranking, top-N queries, or analyzing performance within groups."

      "input": "I have a table called `orders` with columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `total_amount`. I want to calculate the average order value per customer for the last quarter, considering only customers who have placed more than 3 orders in that period. Can you generate an SQL query for this, using a CTE?",
      "output": "Yes, we can solve this using a Common Table Expression (CTE) and aggregation. Here is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH CustomerOrderCounts AS (\n    -- Count orders and calculate the sum of total amounts per customer in the last quarter\n    SELECT\n        customer_id,\n        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,\n        SUM(total_amount) AS total_customer_amount\n    FROM\n        orders\n    WHERE\n        order_date >= DATEADD(quarter, -1, GETDATE()) -- Assuming SQL Server for GETDATE() and DATEADD()\n        -- For PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite: order_date >= date('now', '-3 months') or specific quarter functions\n    GROUP BY\n        customer_id\n),\nQualifiedCustomers AS (\n    -- Filter customers who placed more than 3 orders in the last quarter\n    SELECT\n        customer_id,\n        total_customer_amount,\n        total_orders\n    FROM\n        CustomerOrderCounts\n    WHERE\n        total_orders > 3\n)\n-- Calculate the average order value for the qualified customers\nSELECT\n    qc.customer_id,\n    qc.total_customer_amount / qc.total_orders AS average_order_value_per_customer\nFROM\n    QualifiedCustomers qc;\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Query:**\n\n1.  **`CustomerOrderCounts` CTE**: This CTE calculates, for each customer, the total number of orders (`total_orders`) and the sum of the total amounts (`total_customer_amount`) within the last quarter. The `WHERE` clause filters the data based on the `order_date` for the last quarter. Note that the date function (`DATEADD`, `GETDATE`) may need to be adjusted depending on your specific SQL dialect (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL).\n2.  **`QualifiedCustomers` CTE**: This CTE builds upon the first CTE and filters out customers who have placed more than 3 orders within the defined period. This ensures that only relevant customers are considered for the final calculation.\n3.  **Final `SELECT` statement**: The final `SELECT` statement then calculates the average order value per qualified customer by dividing `total_customer_amount` by `total_orders` from the `QualifiedCustomers` CTE. This structure enhances the readability and maintainability of the query, especially for complex conditions."
